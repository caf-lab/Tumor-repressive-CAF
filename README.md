# Tumor-repressive-fibroblast subpopulation. 
Generallly activated fibroblasts and CAF (cancer associated fibroblasts) are known to promote tumor progression. However, some minor subpopulation of fibroblast is suspected to repress tumor progression and there is little known for this subpopulation. In this study, we searched for tumor repressive fibroblasts subpopulation in cancer tissue of colon cancer using single cell RNA/ATAC-seq data.
